===================================

**gendata** is a package that provides an API for reading and operating on genetic data in python. It is capable of loading genetic data in `PLINK's <https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/>`_ `bed/bim/fam <https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input>`_ format, performing simple operations on this genetic data, and saving genetic data objects to bed/bim/fam file format.
